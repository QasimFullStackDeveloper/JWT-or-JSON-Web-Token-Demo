🔐 JWT Auth API in ASP.NET Core (Full Demo with Roles & Refresh Tokens)

A complete and beginner-friendly implementation of JWT authentication and authorization using ASP.NET Core Web APIs. This project covers secure user login, token generation, password hashing, token expiry, refresh tokens, and role-based access control — all built with clean, simple folder structure and easily understandable code.

It uses SQLite as the database, so there's no need to install or configure any external database server — just clone, build, and run. A built-in Scalar UI is included for testing API endpoints.

This is ideal for learning how JWT works in ASP.NET Core or for using it as a base for your own secure API.

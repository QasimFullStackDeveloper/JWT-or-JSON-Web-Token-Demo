# JWT-or-JSON-Web-Token-Demo
This project is a complete and practical implementation of JWT-based authentication and authorization in a backend application. It includes full coverage of core security features like access tokens, refresh tokens, and role-based access control. The goal is to provide a clear, production-ready example of how to handle secure user sessions.
